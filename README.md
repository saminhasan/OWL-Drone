TODO :
  
- clean Valorant UI image.
- add no signal backgounrd for skipped frames.
- lower bit rate and resolution  for smoother control (control signals mostly goes through, even if video freezes).
- add click to tag objects(maybe tag using semantation and use opencv methods to track) which glows and use a EKF or something to predict motion if tracking is lost.
